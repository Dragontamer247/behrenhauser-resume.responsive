        <h3>Objectives/Goals</h3>
          <p>
            I grew up going to multiple schools spending most of my education at Garden Spot in New Holland, Pennsylvania. Throughout my education I picked up major skills in Math, English, and a minor in Computer Programming during High School. I have moved on to an enrollment of Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology in Lancaster, and I am currently enrolled in Computer Software Engineering Technology. Though I have no work experience as of yet I am very passionate of this career and hope to pursue it for many years to come. It would be my dream and passion to work for a company that will gracefully allow me to gain experience whilst I work. I hope to ensure a place not only in the company, but in the employees as a beneficial and reliable friend.

          During my education in Garden Spot High School I had achieved average grades for classes not affiliated in Math, English, and Computer Programming.

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>
          From my school experience I have picked up a lot on team communication and co-operation. I work well to try and please others, focussing on representing the efficiency of my squad as a whole. I learned to prevent laziness, procrastination, and imediately focus on getting the job done right the first time. I even adapt well to new surroundings very easily.

        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <h4>Company: Zerbe Sisters Nursing Center</h4>
        <h5>Employment: Kitchen Staff</h5>
        <p>
          In the past summer jobs, I had applied to work for a retirement home known as Zerbe Sisters. Though it has gone through many changes since I had left, I did leave on great terms on which I could return to the job if I pleased. For work experience I worked on everything kitchen and dinner related services, and I did all of it to the fullest. I was considered equal to my superiors and was highly remarked from my co-workers. I worked at Zerbe Sisters for a full year before I resigned to go to college in April leaving on great terms.

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          From starting out as a computer gamer, I was much more interested in learning the code and finding out ways to "hack" the game I played. I have minor knowledge on "hot fixing" files to my liking and have moderate skill on scanning the minor details of a program to try and find a glitch. I currently just spend time finding glitches or modifying game code to document how programs work and how you can change them.
